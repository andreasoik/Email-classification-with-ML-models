# Email-classification-with-ML-models
I completed a data analysis project in which I conducted an analysis of spam email messages. I implemented a variety of algorithms and fine-tuned hyperparameters to explore and identify the best model. Some techniques I utilized included TF-IDF vectorization, SVD, and grid search of machine learning algorithms using Python (scikit-learn).
